### Everything you need to know before watching F1

#### F1 Teams
There are currently 10 teams which participate in F1. Each team is required to have 2 drivers, thus a total of 20 cars race on a race weekend.

#### Race weekend
Each formula 1 race happens over a weekend. Fridays are usually reserved for practice, Saturday for qualifying and Sunday for race. On rare occasions, it may change like if a washout happens due to heavy rain, but usually this is the norm.

#### Practice
There are three free practice (FP) sessions - FP1, FP2 and FP3. FP1 and FP2 are scheduled for friday and FP3 for Saturday just before qualifying.

FP1 -  90 min  
FP2 - 90 min  
FP3 - 60 min

This is a chance for drivers to learn the track, change the car setup according to their preferences and give feedback to the team to improve the car. 
Teams also test any new upgrades which they have brought, tyre performance, right fuel mixture among other things.

#### Qualifying
After FP3 on saturday morning, now is the time for qualifying. Qualifying determines the starting position of the cars for the race. Qualifying is a knockout format consisting of 3 stages. First stage is of 18 minutes where drivers try to setup the fastest lap around the track with minimum fuel and fresh rubber (tyres).  Last 5 drivers (in position 16-20) are eliminated post the completion of Q1 and their race position is decided based on this.

Q2 is of 15 min. This presents an opportunity for remaining 15 drivers to earn a higher spot on the grid. At the end of the stage, 5 drivers (from 11th-15th position) are eliminated. Importantly, the top 10 drivers who moved on to Q3 will have to start the race on which they have set the fastest time in Q2. This was introduces to give slight advantage to drivers outside top 10 to move up the field and gain position at the start of the race.

Q3 is final stage of 12 min where top 10 drivers shoot for pole (first) position. They usually do two flying (fastest) laps. First one is a banker lap which in other words is just an insurance against any unforseen circumstances. The second one is usually done just before the end of the stage in order to take advantage of track evolution. Track usually becomes faster due to increasing track temperature and more rubber being put on the track which makes it easier for f1 cars to grip the track and go faster. The order is then set for the race.

#### Race
Race happens on sunday and is of maximum 2 hours. Number of laps is not fixed and is usually the minimum number of laps needed to complete 305 Km distance. Hence a shorter track like Mexico (Hermanos Rodr√≠guez) has 71 laps and a longer track like Spa has 44 laps. 

THE START: Drivers line up on the grid as determined by the qualifying. 5 lights start the countdown with each light becoming red after 1 second each. When all 5 lights are red, after an nonfixed time, all of them go out at the same time which signals the start of the race.

All cars race around the track stopping only for a pitstop. Pitstop is a stop in the pitlane where the mechanics change the tyres of the car in mere seconds. Sometime pitstop may also be needed to repair any damage on the car like changing frontwing. 1 pitstop is mandatory in the race where cars must switch to a new type of tyre compound than the one which they started the race with. 

Points are awarded to top 10 drivers only based on the order in which they cross the finish line. Since F1 is a team sport, teams collects the points which are awarded to both of their drivers in aggregate.

#### Championship
After the season which covers somewhere around 20-25 races, driver and the team with the highest points are awared the championship. Driver gets the World Drivers Title, whereas the team gets the World Constructors Title. Constructors title is important not just for the marketing purposes, but also for the prize money which is distributed based on the final team rankings.
