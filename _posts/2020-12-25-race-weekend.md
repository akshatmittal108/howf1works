### Everything you need to know before watching F1

#### Race weekend

##### F1
There are currently 10 teams which participate in F1. Each team is required to have 2 drivers, thus a total of 20 race cars on a race weekend.

##### Race format
Each formula 1 race happens over a weekend. Fridays are usually reserved for practice, Saturday for qualifying and Sunday for race. On rare occasions, it may change like if a washout happens due to heavy rain, but usually this is the norm.

##### Practice
There are three free practice (FP) sessions - FP1, FP2 and FP3. FP1 and FP2 are scheduled for friday and FP3 for Saturday just before qualifying.

* FP1 : 90 min  
* FP2 : 90 min  
* FP3 : 60 min

This is a chance for drivers to learn the track, change the car setup according to their preferences and give feedback to the team to improve the car. 
Teams also test any new upgrades which they have brought, tyre performance, right fuel mixture among other things.

##### Qualifying
After FP3 on saturday morning, now is the time for qualifying. Qualifying determines the starting position of the cars for the race. Qualifying is a knockout format consisting of 3 stages. First stage is of 18 minutes where drivers try to setup the fastest lap around the track with minimum fuel and fresh rubber (tyres).  Last 5 drivers (in position 16-20) are eliminated post the completion of Q1 and their race position is decided based on this.

Q2 is of 15 min. This presents an opportunity for remaining 15 drivers to earn a higher spot on the grid. At the end of the stage, 5 drivers (from 11th-15th position) are eliminated. Importantly, the top 10 drivers who moved on to Q3 will have to start the race on which they have set the fastest time in Q2. This was introduces to give slight advantage to drivers outside top 10 to move up the field and gain position at the start of the race.

Q3 is final stage of 12 min where top 10 drivers shoot for pole (first) position. They usually do two flying (fastest) laps. First one is a banker lap which in other words is just an insurance against any unforseen circumstances. The second one is usually done just before the end of the stage in order to take advantage of track evolution. Track usually becomes faster due to increasing track temperature and more rubber being put on the track which makes it easier for f1 cars to grip the track and go faster. The order is then set for the race.

* Q1 : 16th-20th positions finalized
* Q2 : 11th-15th positions finalized
* Q3 : 1st - 10th positions finalized

##### Race
Race happens on sunday and is of maximum 2 hours. Number of laps is not fixed and is usually the minimum number of laps needed to complete 305 Km distance. Hence a shorter track like Mexico (Hermanos Rodr√≠guez) has 71 laps and a longer track like Spa has 44 laps. 

THE START: Drivers line up on the grid as determined by the qualifying. 5 lights start the countdown with each light becoming red after 1 second each. When all 5 lights are red, after an nonfixed time, all of them go out at the same time which signals the start of the race.

All cars race around the track stopping only for a pitstop. Pitstop is a stop in the pitlane where the mechanics change the tyres of the car in mere seconds. Sometime pitstop may also be needed to repair any damage on the car like changing frontwing. 1 pitstop is mandatory in the race where cars must switch to a new type of tyre compound than the one which they started the race with. 

Points are awarded to top 10 drivers only based on the order in which they cross the finish line. Since F1 is a team sport, teams collects the points which are awarded to both of their drivers in aggregate.

##### Championship
After the season which covers somewhere around 20-25 races, driver and the team with the highest points are awared the championship. Driver gets the World Drivers Title, whereas the team gets the World Constructors Title. Constructors title is important not just for the marketing purposes, but also for the prize money which is distributed based on the final team rankings.

### Parts of a car

**Cockpit** - This is the place where drivers sit much like the cockpit of a fighter plane. It is enclosed by a survival cell which is lined with carbon fibre which makes it extremely rigid and safe for the drivers. Further, for safety reasons, no fuel wires are allowed to pass through it.

**Front wing** - This is the front portion of the car which has a primary portion of manipulating the airflow across the whole car in order provide the maxium aerodynamic efficience with minimum amount of drag. 

**Halo** - Since F1 is an open-cockpit racing series, it is a safety equipment introduced quite recently to protect the head of the drivers from any flying debris including any tyres.

**Barge boards** - These are complex aerodynamic components on the side of the cars to direct the airflow around parts of the car for minimum drag. This allows car to cut through the air much like how a hot knife through butter.

**Tyres** - Tyres are the only things which are in contact with the race track and hence their condition has impact on the grip levels which the car has and subsequently their speed. They are highly sensitive to temperature and must be kept within optimial tyre temperature to extract maximum grip out of them. That's why you see cars weaving before the start of the race to bring them upto temperature for the race start. Teams are given 3 types of tyre compounds - soft, medium and hard with different levels of degradation. For wet conditions, there are two additional compounds - intermediates (for light rain) and wets (for heavy rain). In case of a dry race, it is mandatory for driver to use atleast 2 different tyre compounds.

**Rear wing** - This is the rear portion of the car which is most recognizable part of the car since it's part of almost all 4-wheeler motorport events. It imparts maximum downforce to the car to keep it stable and includes DRS as well.

**DRS** - Drag reduction system is an adjustable rear wing of the car which enables a car to have higher speed down the straight thereby allowing them to overtake the car in front of them. In order to activate DRS, the car must be within 1 second of the car in front of it and should be in DRS zones only. This was done to assit cars in overtaking since overtaking is difficult for f1 cars due to dirty air.

**Engine** - Current generation of engines are hybrid, that is using both fuel and electrical energy. They are highly efficient and reliable now. Teams are allowed to use at max 3 engines throughout the F1 season. Using any additional components come with penalty. Engines are 1.6L V6 engines. Engines are equipped with KERS (Kinetic Engine Recovery System) which allow the kinetic and heat energy generated from applying the brakes to be converted to electric energy stored in a battery to be deployed in critical situations like going for an overtake or defending.

### Safety car and VSC
Racing at such high speeds carry with it a lot of risks. Occasionally we see a few accidents and crashes. Fortunately because of improvements in safety in F1, there are rarely any serious injuries. In case of any risky driving conditions (either due to a crash or terrible weather), Safety car or Virtual Safety car is deployed to slow down the cars to reduce any potential risk to the drivers.

In Safety car period, a safety car is deployed. Drivers are expected to line up behind it and just tug along at a consistent speed. Drivers are waved double yellow flags and no overtaking is allowed for the duration of safety car. Race resumes only after the race conditions are deemed safe enough for racing and the safety car comes back into the pits.

In Virtual Safety car, there is no safety car deployed as such but the drivers are notified of it on their steering dashboard and are expected to maintain constant speed limit (much lower than normal racing speed) with no overtaking alowed. Unlike in Safety car period, the relative difference in the distance between the cars still remain the same as what was before the VSC period.

### Flags

**Yellow flag** - Yellow flag is the most common one and is shown to drivers to make them cautious and to look out for potential hazard on the track. Overtaking is prohibited and they must slow down in the part of the track where the flag is being shown. Double yellows are shown for a hazard which is blocking the track . Same restrictions apply over here as well and the driver must be prepared to stop if instructed.

**Green flag** - Green flag is shown usually post yellow flags to denote "normal conditions" where drivers can resume racing each other normally at race pace.

**Blue flag** - Blue flag is shown to the drivers who are being lapped by the cars who are a lap ahead. This allows them to get out of the way without disrupting the race of the drivers a lap ahead.

**Red flag** - "Red flagging" a race means to stop the race. This is usually done in case of a big accident or when the track conditions are not suited for racing. The race is restarted when the track and conditions are deemed safe enough to go racing. Pure racing time should be under 2 hours with a provision to extend total time to 4 hours to take delays into account.

**Black flag** - Blag flag is shown to the driver who is disqualified from the race. This is done only in very rare circumstances when a driver is flouting rules or putting other drivers at risk.

**Black and white flag** - This flag is a warning to a driver who is doing dangerous driving. Any more instances of dangerous driving would invite penalty or in extreme conditions, race disqualification.

**Chequered flag** - Chequered flag is the one which would be most recognizable with racing. It signals the end of the race and is waved when then leader of the race is about to cross the finish line. Final race results is determined by the order in which drivers cross the finish line.

### Strategy

Teams compete as much as on-track as off-track. There is a mandatory pit stop which teams must make to switch to a different tyre compound. Because of varying performance of the tyres (due to tyre degradation which happens with every lap and leads to decrease in the grip levels) and importance of having track poition (due to difficulty in overtaking), varying strategies are used by the teams to increase the chances of their drivers finishing higher-up in the final standings.

**Undercut** - This means that the driver who is behind, comes in for the pit-stop in order to fit in new tyres. The increase in grip levels would allow him to put faster lap times and potentially allow him overtake the opponent who was ahead of him when he decides to come in for the pit-stop.

**Overcut** - In this the driver who is behind opts for a pitstop later than his opponent. This is done when there is potential to go for faster lap times on the existing set of tyres and also banking on the fact that new tyres on his opponents car take some time to get upto optimal temperatures especially when the conditions are cold.
